    "🟢 SECTION A: CONCEPTUAL (WITH ANSWERS)\n",
    "Q1. What is a problem in computer science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "A problem is a task that takes input, processes it using well-defined steps, and produces output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is an algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "An algorithm is a finite, ordered set of unambiguous steps to solve a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is the difference between a program and an algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm: Logic / steps (language independent)\n",
    "\n",
    "Program: Implementation of algorithm in a specific language\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is a data structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so it can be accessed and modified efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Why do we need data structures?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "To improve efficiency, reduce time and memory usage, and handle large-scale data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Define Primitive data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Primitive data types store a single value and cannot be divided further (int, float, bool).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Define Non-Primitive data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Non-primitive data structures store multiple values and define relationships between data elements (array, list, dict).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Is list primitive or non-primitive? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Non-primitive, because it stores multiple values and supports operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Is int primitive or non-primitive?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Primitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Can an algorithm exist without a data structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "No. Even the simplest algorithm needs some form of data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "🟡 SECTION B: CODE UNDERSTANDING\n",
    "Q11. Identify primitive and non-primitive:\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "c = {\"x\": 1}\n",
    "\n",

    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "a → Primitive\n",

    "    for x in nums:\n",
    "        if x > 0:\n",
    "            c += 1\n",
    "    return c\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Counts positive numbers in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13. Is tuple primitive or non-primitive?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Non-primitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14. Which is more complex: array or integer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Array (non-primitive).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15. Give one real-world example of a stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Stack of plates.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔴 SECTION C: THINKING / INTERVIEW STYLE\n",
    "Q16. Why are non-primitive structures required for algorithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Algorithms often work on collections of data, not single values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q17. What happens if we only had primitive data types?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "We could not store or process large datasets efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q18. Which data structure would you use to store student records?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Dictionary (key-value mapping).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q19. Is recursion an algorithm or data structure?\n",
